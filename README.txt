yosysZKP is a tool for performing Zero-Knowledge Proofs.

For information about Zero Knowledge proofs see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof

yosysZKP uses a protocol which is very much like http://eprint.iacr.org/2014/934.pdf 
but which was independently derived from http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/073/20130220:185223

yosysZKP is meant to be practical in the sense that a non-expert should be able to use yosysZKP to 
prove non-trivial statements to a third-party.
